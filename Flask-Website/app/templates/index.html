                       This chart is showing the percentage of ratings that people chose and whether they were satisfied or not. In the satisfied chart very little people chose 1, 2, or 3, while in the dissatisfied chart the ratings are more even, and less people chose 5. With this information we can conclude that people tend to see on-board service as important and will most likely be satisfied if it were a 4 or 5. That is why more people tended to be more satisfied with their flight when they rated it a 4 or 5.

In this graph, we see the distribution of ages across the different classes. We see that across all of the different classes age doesn't really change that much.

                          In order to make accurate predictions, we tested a variety of machine learning models. They each functioned differently and used different methods to make predictions, generating a variety of outcomes. Since we are solving a classification problem (determining one outcome or the other), we used models that are meant for classification problems. We used four metrics: precision, recall, accuracy, and f-1 score to compare the effectiveness of each model at making predictions, and we’ll refer to these collectively as PRAF. We also used a process called hyperparameter tuning (through a function called GridSearchCV) to improve each model’s “base performance”, sort of like getting the model familiar with how the data would be organized before it started processing.

                        <p class="descript-text">
                          A Random Forest model is a model that generates a given number of randomized decision trees and uses averaging functions to combine its results from the trees and make predictions on the data. This allows for more accurate predictions as randomizing decision trees allows the model to individually look for correlations between sections of the dataset, making predictions more intuitive, compared to looking at the entire dataset through one decision tree, as it is harder to find patterns when there are more variables to consider. <br> <br> Through hyperparameter tuning, we found that a larger number of trees correlated to a more accurate result, though by ~30 trees, the increase in accuracy was negligible compared to the amount of added processing time the model took. After hyperparameter tuning, the Random Forest model was quite effective in making predictions based on our data. It had a PRAF of ~0.95, meaning that it was making accurate predictions 95% of the time.

                        <p class="descript-text">
                          The Categorical Naive Bayes model works using the Bayes Theorem, an algorithm that assigns probabilities to individual features and uses those probabilities to predict an outcome. It assumes that individual features are dependent on each other, which works well with our dataset. We chose the Categorical Naive Bayes model because it works best for categorical data and we have a lot of categorical data in the form of 1-5 ratings for the airline's performance. <br> <br> During hyperparameter tuning, we found that an alpha (a factor that smooths the data for outliers) value of 3 seemed to slightly improve the model, but further increases in alpha didn't make a significant difference. After hyperparameter tuning, the Categorical Naive Bayes model had a PRAF of ~0.9, meaning that it was making accurate predictions around 90% of the time.

                        A Decision Tree Classifier uses the given data to generate a decision tree, a group of “questions” that make up several paths to different outcomes. For each prediction, the decision tree uses the testing data to answer these “questions” and follows a path based on its answers. Upon reaching a set depth, or length of the path, the model then produces a prediction based on the path it followed. <br> <br> Through hyperparameter tuning, we found that a maximum depth of 4 and a minimum sample leaf (a value that requires a set amount of training data before the model can create a “question”) of 5 were the most effective hyperparameters for our data. After hyperparameter tuning, the Decision Tree Classifier model had a PRAF of ~0.92, meaning that it was making accurate predictions around 92% of the time.

                        A K-Nearest Neighbors model is a classification model that works by finding the distance between a piece of testing data and all the training data in the dataset. A k-value is used to find the k-number of closest training data points. The model finds which class the majority of the k-closest data points are in, and classifies the testing data point to that class. <br> <br> Through hyperparameter tuning, we found that a k-value of 3 works best, and weighting the data (assigning different “priorities” to each data point based on a certain factor) based on their distance from the testing point was most effective. After hyperparameter tuning, the K-Nearest Neighbors model had a PRAF of ~0.63, meaning that it was not making a lot of accurate predictions around 63% of the time, which is not very good.

                      <p class="descript-text">
                        The AdaBoost Classifier model makes a bunch of smaller, “weak learning” models that perform about as good as random guessing. After each weak learning model is made, it makes predictions on the testing data, and the predictions that the model gets wrong are given a heavier weight, meaning that the next weak learning model will focus on getting that prediction right. After creating a bunch of these weak learning models, the classifier combines all the results of the models to create a majority result that is used to make the final predictions. <br> <br> We didn’t perform hyperparameter tuning on this model, so our results used the default hyperparameters. The AdaBoost Classifier model had a PRAF of ~0.93, which is actually pretty good for an untuned model, predicting accurately around 93% of the time.

                        The Logistic Regression model is a classification model despite its name, and it works by creating a logistic function to match the dataset that is given to it. This logistic function determines probabilities, and when testing data is placed on the graph of the function, the position of the testing data outputs a probability that the model uses to make a prediction. <br> <br> We didn’t perform hyperparameter tuning on this model because there wasn’t much to tune. The Logistic Regression model has a PRAF of ~0.8, which means that it predicts accurately around 80% of the time.

The model adds more regression or classification functions underneath the model it chooses to optimize, which makes predictions more accurate in some cases. <br> <br> Using hyperparameter tuning, we found that the best base model to apply optimizations to was the logarithmic loss function. The Stochastic Gradient Descent model had a PRAF of ~0.82, meaning that is predicts accurately around 82% of the time.

                        <li>The Random Forest model did the best in all of the fields with a score of 95% for accuracy an 94% for recall, precision, and f1 score.</li>
                        <li>The K-Nearest Neighbors model performed the worst in accuracy, recall, and f1 score, averaging scores in the low 60%’s. The SGD model without hyperparameter tuning performed the worst in precision.</li>
                        <li>The Random Forest model did a good job of predicting because it’s scores are very high (90%+ for all metrics). Therefore we think our model would work well for classifying if a passenger was satisfied or not satisfied. We noticed as well that the models that are performing well are all tree based. Categorical Naive Bayes, SGD, and Logistic Regression are all mid tier models and performed very well in the 80 range for all scores but they did not outperform the best model in any fields.</li>
                        <li>The grid search improved the SGD model but it did not help the Decision Tree model. SGD had a higher recall score which means that it had less false negatives (predicted 0 and was actually 1) then the grid search model. This means that the grid search model is being too aggressive and saying too many things are negative.</li>
                        <li>The grid search for the Decision Tree model hurt the model and there are a couple explanations we have for that. One answer is that when training these models, there’s variance so that means that the decision trees can be more optimized or less optimized which means we might have a bad decision tree. Our grid search probably wasn’t expansive enough and so we’d want to try to look at more values for our parameters.</li>

For our project, we wanted to create a machine learning model that could predict whether someone enjoyed their flight or not and determine which aspects of a flight experience are most important to customers. <br> <br>

As a first step, we created visualizations of our data in order to better understand the data ourselves and help other people understand it as well. Using plotly, we made many different types of visualizations, such as matrices, histograms, bar graphs, scatter plots, and pie charts. Our team also used seaborn to create other graphs like correlation matrices. We then analyzed the information, wrote about what we could conclude from it, and discussed what we thought was happening (correlations, patterns, etc.). <br> <br>

To make predictions based on the data, we used many different machine learning models. To make these models effective, we needed to learn how to do hyperparameter tuning. In fact, almost everything we accomplished throughout the project was something we had to learn from scratch. Most of us came in with little to no coding knowledge, and this caused many issues but we managed to solve all of them in the end. We used GridSearchCV to find out the best parameters for our models. After we made and tuned all of them, we compared them to figure out some issues, explore what we could work to improve, and finally decide on the best model, which was the random forest. <br> <br>

In the end, we succeeded after a lot of hard work and effort. We had made a model with .95 accuracy and concluded that class and online boarding play major roles in one's satisfaction. We used survey data to help determine important factors in airline satisfaction, but there are several things wrong with survey data. Most of the responses were subjective, meaning that there could be bias, and there are many small variables the airline may have no control over that could affect a rating. If we wanted to make a more objective model, we would ask if people were satisfied or not, and then look for concrete statistics such as leg room in centimeters, or find the airline that they flew in: various things that we can measure and that are constant throughout all flights. We could then judge what factors are most important more easily.
