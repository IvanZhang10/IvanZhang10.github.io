                        The percentage of people who are satisfied or unsatisfied based on the convenience on departure and arrival times. This has many variables, but overall, it seems like there  was only a slight difference between the satisfaction ratings, meaning that it's not as important to passengers.

                      The percentage of people who were satisfied or neutral/dissatisfied in relation to their leg room rating. This can be the result of the quality of flight, which explains why the higher the rating, the more likely the customer was satisfied.

                      The percentage of people who were satisfied or dissatisfied in relation to their rating on the inflight wi-fi service. Overall, it seems that wi-fi is very important to customers, as those who were satisfied typically had a higher rating on the wi-fi, mostly four or five. In fact, less than 1% who rated a 5 for wifi were unsatisfied.

                    What class a person was in, and whether their flight is short, medium, or long. Short flights mostly carry Eco passengers, and most Eco plus passengers take short flights. Medium distance flights are about half Business passengers. Long distance flights are almost only Business passengers, with less then one percent being either Eco or Eco Plus.
